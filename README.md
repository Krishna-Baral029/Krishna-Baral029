👋 Hi, I’m Krishna Baral, I'm from Shree Pokhariya Secondary School studying at Class - 11 tech. Batch 2025

👀 I’m interested in Coding, App Development, Web Development, Game Development, Python Development, Software Development, Blender, Unity/Unreal Engine and Exploring new Tech

🌱 I’m currently learning to animate a 3D model using Blender and making a game name: "COV" [Crime Over Virtue]
📢 The games trailer is gonna release in: December 15 2025

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with developers and creators passionate about games, software and innovation with the help of discord. If anyone interested please contact me via social medias.

📂 Projects I already build
Cracking youtube security and building a youtube video/audio/Thumbnail and Creator's profile pic Downloader
Tiktok video/ logo/ profile downloader [Live demo: Freetikzone.onrender.com]
⚠️ Warning: Website takes time to load since it is a free trial so be sure you have enough time for me to watch that out

A music player app: Sonnix.netlify.app 🎵 Play any songs you want compatible for both mobile and laptop
⚠️ Warning: Not responsive on all desktop zoom levels, in some devices it works at 67% and in some it works well at 100% so that's your choice how you want the responsiveness
🤯 Fun and crazy fact: You can even download musics/ playlist from this web app and simply listen your downloaded musics/songs offline

etc... I have build many more...
